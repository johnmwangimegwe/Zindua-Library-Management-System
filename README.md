## üöÄ Overview

The **Zindua Library Management System** is a Python-based application designed to streamline library operations. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing books, borrowers, and transactions, with features like book borrowing, returning, fine calculation, and search functionality. The system uses CSV files for data storage and a Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction.

---
## Inspiration

In a world where AI and technology are evolving rapidly, the need to optimize resources and automate repetitive tasks has become more critical than ever. At Zindua, I recognized the challenges faced by libraries in managing books, borrowers, and transactions manually. These challenges include human errors, book loss, and inefficiencies in tracking borrowed books. To address these issues, I developed the **Zindua Library Management System (LMS)** to automate library processes, reduce errors, and encourage reading by rewarding loyalty points.

As the saying goes, *"If you find yourself doing the same task today, and you are confident you will do it the exact same way tomorrow and in the future, then it's time to automate that process."* ‚Äì **Michael Peeler**. This quote underscores the importance of automation in streamlining workflows and improving efficiency.

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/johnmwangimegwe/Zindua-Library-Management-System.git
cd Zindua-Library-Management-System
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install tkinter
```
3. Initialize data files:
```
python database.py
```
4. Start the system:
```
python main.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
- Data Compression: Implement CSV data compression to handle large datasets efficiently, reducing storage requirements and improving performance.
- Change History Logging: Introduce a logging system to track changes made to book and borrower records, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- Backup System: Automate CSV file backups to prevent data loss and ensure data integrity in case of system failures.
- Enhanced GUI: Add more interactive elements like charts and graphs to provide better insights into library operations and user activity.
- MPESA Integration: Implement the Daraja API to enable users to pay fines automatically and conveniently using MPESA, streamlining the payment process and enhancing user experience.

## üí™ Challenges We Ran Into
- Implementing the graphical user interface (GUI) while ensuring all features worked seamlessly together. Integrating the Tkinter library with the backend logic required careful planning and debugging to ensure smooth functionality. 
- Managing data consistency across multiple CSV files posed a challenge, especially during simultaneous read/write operations. Despite these obstacles, I persevered, leveraging Python's robust libraries and modular programming practices to deliver a functional and user-friendly system.

2. Security Measures
```
# File: auth.py
import hashlib

def hash_password(password):
    """Secure password hashing"""
    return hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()

def validate_credentials(username, password):
    with open('Borrowers.csv', 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for user in reader:
            if user['Name'] == username and user['Password'] == hash_password(password):
                return True
    return False
```
3. Search System
```
# File: search.py
def search_books(field, value):
    """Generic CSV search function"""
    results = []
    with open('Books.csv', 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for book in reader:
            if value.lower() in book[field].lower():
                results.append(book)
    return results
```
## Setup & Usage
